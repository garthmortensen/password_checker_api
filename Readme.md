# Password Checker API

This project aims to accomplish a few things:

- Create an API

  - It will check if the user has entered 3 invalid passwords.

- Factor code into several .py files, and use:

  ```py
  from filename import function
  ```

- Provide clear, standard documentation. That means putting images in the /images/ directory, and use relative links to them in our readme file. We're going to provide the library requirements. Other things?

- Use git branching to coordinate our work.

- Other things?
